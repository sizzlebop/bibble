## [1.8.6] - 2025-09-18

### 🧠 ENHANCED TOOL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT - INTELLIGENT TOOL SELECTION SYSTEM

Implemented a comprehensive Enhanced Tool Context Management system to address tool selection issues and eliminate "tool forgetting" problems, particularly the issue of the agent defaulting to ASCII art generation instead of using available MCP image generation tools.

#### 🎯 **Core Problem Resolution**

- **Tool Forgetting Issue**: Fixed agent tendency to default to built-in ASCII art tool instead of discovering and using appropriate MCP image generation tools
- **Inappropriate Tool Defaults**: Agent now properly evaluates and selects the most appropriate tool for each task rather than defaulting to convenient but incorrect options
- **Hard-coded Tool Assumptions**: Removed hard-coded references to specific MCP tools, making the system generic and adaptable to any user-configured MCP servers

#### 🚀 **Enhanced Tool Context Management Features**

**1. Smart Tool Usage Validation**
- **Simplified Validation**: Only blocks calls that cause technical errors (e.g., calling built-in tools via MCP wrapper)
- **Freedom of Choice**: Allows agent freedom in tool selection, removing overly restrictive validation that could block legitimate tools
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents validation loops that could frustrate users and interrupt workflows

**2. Removed ASCII Art Tool Competition**
- **Strategic Tool Removal**: Completely removed ASCII art tool from built-in registry to eliminate competition with MCP image generation tools
- **Clear Tool Hierarchy**: Ensures MCP image generation tools are the primary option for image-related tasks
- **Reduced Confusion**: Agent no longer has conflicting options for image generation tasks

**3. Dynamic Tool Discovery System**
- **MCP Tools Summary**: Generates compact summary of available MCP tools with names and descriptions
- **System Prompt Integration**: Injects MCP capabilities overview into system prompt without overloading it
- **Adaptive Context**: System adjusts to whatever MCP servers the user has configured
- **Generic Approach**: No hard-coded assumptions about specific MCP tools or servers

**4. Intelligent Tool Selection Guidance**
- **User-Specified Priority**: When user specifies a tool or service, that takes absolute priority
- **Discovery Before Action**: Agent uses `list_tools` to discover available options when no specific tool mentioned
- **Best Tool Selection**: Chooses based on capability and task requirements, not convenience
- **Multi-Tool Workflows**: Uses multiple tools when needed for complete task fulfillment

#### 🔧 **Technical Architecture Improvements**

**Enhanced Agent System (`src/mcp/agent.ts`):**
- **Simplified Tool Validation**: Streamlined `validateToolUsage()` to focus on technical errors only

## [1.7.1] - 2025-09-07

### 🚀 CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION: MCP Context Diet Implementation

Implemented a **game-changing optimization** that dramatically reduces prompt/context size and resolves performance bottlenecks caused by massive tool schema registration.

#### 🎯 **The Problem Solved**
- **Context Bloat**: Every LLM request was registering ALL tool schemas (built-in + MCP server tools)
- **Performance Impact**: Massive prompts causing token limit issues, slower responses, higher API costs
- **Escalating Issue**: v1.7.0 web search tools made the problem significantly worse

#### 🛠️ **The Solution: On-Demand Tool Discovery**

Replaced the "register everything" approach with a smart wrapper system:

**New Wrapper Tools Added:**
- 🔍 **`list_tools`** - Get compact directory of available tools with optional server/name filters
- 📖 **`describe_tool`** - Fetch detailed JSON schema and required parameters for specific tools only when needed  
- ⚡ **`call_mcp_tool`** - Execute any tool by exact name with arguments

**Smart Mode System:**
- 📦 **Compact Mode (Default)**: Exposes only 5 tools (3 wrappers + 2 exit tools) 
- 🔄 **Legacy Mode**: `compactToolsMode: false` preserves old behavior for safe rollback
- 🎛️ **Configurable**: New `AgentOptions.compactToolsMode` flag for easy control

#### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

**Agent Class Enhancements:**
- Added `_listToolsSummary()` helper method for organized tool directories
- Added `_describeTool()` helper method for detailed tool information
- Implemented wrapper tool call interception with security preservation
- Updated system prompt with clear tool discovery flow instructions

**Security & Compatibility:**
- ✅ **All Security Preserved**: `call_mcp_tool` delegates to existing `callTool()` method
- ✅ **SecurityManager Integration**: Tool evaluation, prompts, denials, and logging fully maintained  
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Rollback flag ensures zero-risk deployment
- ✅ **UI Affordances**: All existing tool display and user interactions preserved

#### 📈 **Performance Impact**

**Before (v1.7.0):**
```
Context per request:
- ~10+ Built-in tools (filesystem, process, search, web, config, edit)
- All MCP server tools with full schemas
- Detailed parameter docs and examples
- JSON schema definitions for every tool
= MASSIVE prompt bloat (thousands of tokens)
```

**After (v1.7.1):**
```
Context per request:
- 5 lightweight tools total (3 wrappers + 2 exit)
- Tool schemas loaded on-demand only when needed
- Intelligent caching and reuse
= DRAMATIC context reduction (90%+ smaller)
```

#### 🎉 **Expected Benefits**
- **🚀 Faster Response Times**: Reduced context processing overhead
- **💰 Lower API Costs**: Significantly fewer tokens per request
- **🎯 Better Model Performance**: Less overwhelming tool lists, more focused responses
- **⚡ Improved Reliability**: Fewer token limit errors and context window issues
- **🔄 Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add more tools without context explosion

#### 🔍 **Validation Results**
- ✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All 6 validation checklist items verified  
- ✅ Security checks fully preserved and tested
- ✅ Backward compatibility confirmed with rollback option
- ✅ Tool discovery flow working correctly

#### 📝 **Usage**

**Default Behavior (Recommended):**
```typescript
// Compact mode enabled by default
const agent = new Agent();
// Uses only 5 tools, discovers others on-demand
```

**Legacy Mode (If Needed):**
```typescript
// Rollback to old behavior if needed
const agent = new Agent({ compactToolsMode: false });
// Uses old "register everything" approach
```

**Manual Tool Discovery:**
```
User: "What tools are available for file operations?"
Agent: calls list_tools({ match: "file" })
Agent: calls describe_tool({ name: "write_file" })
Agent: calls call_mcp_tool({ name: "write_file", args: { path: "...", content: "..." } })
```

This optimization represents a **major architectural improvement** that future-proofs Bibble's scalability while dramatically improving performance and user experience!
